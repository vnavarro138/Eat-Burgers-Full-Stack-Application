Eat da Burger app (add burgers to be eaten, and eat them)

This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM. 
It uses Node and MySQL to query and routes data, and uses Handlebars to generate HTML

How to Play:
This is a restaurant app that allows userrs to input the name of the burgers they'd like to eat
Start the server by running server.js from the main folder in your command prompt
Type localhost:3000/index in your web browser
Input the name of the burger you'd like to eat, it will display on the left side of page
Each burger displayed has a devour button, click it, and the burger will move to the right side of the page
The app will store every burger in a database, whether it's eaten or not

Have fun!
